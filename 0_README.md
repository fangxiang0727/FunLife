# Jarvis introduction
#named with Jarvis, working as a task manager hopefully
#in this document main introduction for easy understanding of the program, at least I hope so.

the Jarvis will consist of two main parts:
1.should be a easy memo, recorded with a lots of Idea/Task information which already completed or planned or recorded.
2.tag the tasks with marks
  2.1 tag with Importance&Urgence
  2.2 tag with TimeTag, including a StartDate & TaskDurationRequired & ResourceAvailable(X hours/Day) & (CalculatedFinishDate)
  2.3 Project Mode. could show a selected Tasks as a Project, and show them with a GanttChart
  2.4 Calendar Modeï¼Œcould show the tasks acc. to Dates. And a filter for Importance&Urgence
