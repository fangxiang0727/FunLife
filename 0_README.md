# Jarvis introduction
#named with Jarvis, working as a task manager hopefully
#in this document main introduction for easy understanding of the program, at least I hope so.

the Jarvis will consist of two main parts:
1.should be a easy memo, recorded with a lots of task information which already happens or planned or estimated.
2.create a task sequence for time estimatation

item_code module for defining the task
memo is a module work as a pool for planned_task & frequent-called task
currentline module is designed for adjusting the time point for whole task sequence, to meet the real status of current task.
Jarvis is main function, it will call other module and run as the main function.
